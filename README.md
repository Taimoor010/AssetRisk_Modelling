# Financial Modelling Project

## Overview  
This project demonstrates my ability to build, analyze, and evaluate financial models using Python.  
The notebook applies financial modelling techniques to assess business performance, analyze risk, and forecast outcomes.  
It highlights my skills in combining finance concepts with data science methods to provide decision support for business and investment analysis.  

## Key Features  
- **Data Cleaning & Preparation**: preprocessing financial datasets for consistency and reliability  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: identifying patterns, trends, and anomalies in financial indicators  
- **Forecasting Models**: applying statistical and machine learning approaches for revenue, profit, and cash-flow projections  
- **Scenario & Sensitivity Analysis**: evaluating how changes in assumptions impact outcomes  
- **Valuation Methods**: implementing discounted cash flow (DCF) and other modelling techniques  
- **Visualization**: presenting insights with clear, professional plots and charts  

## Tools & Technologies  
- **Python**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for development and reporting  
- **Financial Modelling Concepts**: forecasting, valuation, sensitivity testing
